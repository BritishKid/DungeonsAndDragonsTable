Classes.json only uses single choice for starting equipment, will need to be updated to reflect choices

packs will need to be worked to keep track of what's used in them or seperate out into specific items

Javelins are set to 1gp when they are 5sp

Rage and other similar features will need formatting for description for printing and something else to track in game usage/damage etc

Primal path description needs to be updated to reflect new archetypes]

Brutal Critical - currently a single point, could be added as 3 seperate one each one adds an extra die to counter when we work out how it will be added

Herald of the storm archetype will need formatting and breakdown of choices (similar may be needed for totem)
    - do we treat each choice as a seperate archetype but balance weighting?
